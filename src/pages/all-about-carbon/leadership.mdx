## Board of directors

The Carbon board of directors is comprised of executives across the company who
advise on the direction of Carbon and ensure top level buy-in and resource
allocation to support Carbon's work.

### Responsibilities

- Hold the steering committee, and Carbon as a whole, accountable for delivery
  of design excellence, standards, guidance and business impact.
- Provide the steering committee feedback on business needs, to facilitate a
  Carbon roadmap that meets those needs.
- Champion Carbon adoption and Carbon standards within their organization.
- Where possible, commit to engaging design or development resources from within
  their organization to help accomplish the Carbon roadmap.

The board is supported by the steering committee, whose role is to provide
oversight and direction for Carbon and its community, and related projects.

Advisory board members meet for one half day every quarter, at which they review
a quarterly report from the steering committee. This report details the status
of design quality, adoption, and contribution from the product teams/business
units from the Carbon Design System.
