practitioners to ensure Carbon stays true to the community we're serving.

### Responsibilities

- Promote and support usage of and contribution to the Carbon Design System
  within their organizations.
- Identify and align components/patterns/content that are multiproduct or
  universal, deciding on consolidation when necessary.
- Assess and vote to approve or deny community proposals (for example, if a
  particular PAL might warrant the "Carbon for [x]" title, and if individuals or
  teams can be given _committer_ rights to all or part of the Carbon codebase).
- Approve the creation of projects, including the scope of committed work and
  recommend members who can contribute.
- Assist with standardizing information and tooling to support sharing across

## Board of directors

The Carbon board of directors is comprised of executives across the company who
advise on the direction of Carbon and ensure top level buy-in and resource
allocation to support Carbon's work.

### Responsibilities

- Hold the steering committee, and Carbon as a whole, accountable for delivery
  of design excellence, standards, guidance and business impact.
- Provide the steering committee feedback on business needs, to facilitate a
  Carbon roadmap that meets those needs.
- Champion Carbon adoption and Carbon standards within their organization.
- Where possible, commit to engaging design or development resources from within
  their organization to help accomplish the Carbon roadmap.

The board is supported by the steering committee, whose role is to provide
oversight and direction for Carbon and its community, and related projects.

Advisory board members meet for one half day every quarter, at which they review
a quarterly report from the steering committee. This report details the status
of design quality, adoption, and contribution from the product teams/business
units from the Carbon Design System.
