<PageDescription>

Projects are scoped work initiatives formed by groups of subject matter experts.
They can be formed from scratch, or might comprise an existing guild or group.
They may be permanent initiatives, or formed for work with a clear end point.

</PageDescription>

Projects may be longer or shorter in duration and small or large in resourcing.
No matter what the scale of a project they should always define their
usefulness, value, and impact for our users, the design system and IBM.
