Projects are scoped work initiatives formed by groups of subject matter experts.
They can be formed from scratch, or might comprise an existing guild or group.
They may be permanent initiatives, or formed for work with a clear end point.

## Foundational projects

- Delivers guidance, assets, services used by all projects

## Component projects

- Implements guidance and specifications for a given platform(s) (e.g. web,
  desktop, iOS, Android) in a particular tool, library, or framework along with
  applicable documentation
- Makes the common guidance and specifications usable for designers and
  developers in their tool, library, or framework of choice
- Match the behavior, interaction, visuals, etc. of the canonical component
  projects

## Product projects

- Extends (but is not divergent or in conflict with) guidance and assets from
  foundational and component projects for use among a product or collection of
  products
- Assets published by product projects may be used by other product projects
  (horizontal sharing is encouraged)
- Often includes tooling and implementations to make delivering cohesive work
  faster and simpler for product teams

## Cross-product projects

- Guidance, components, user journeys, etc. where it's advantageous to abstract
  away from product projects (e.g. project members represent many unrelated
  products)
