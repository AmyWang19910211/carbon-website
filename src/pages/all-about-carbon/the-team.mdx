## Overview

Carbon is funded and built by IBM. That means we build for the company’s
business needs. Carbon is also an open source community-driven project. It is
available for anyone to use and everyone is encouraged to contribute.

To sustain productive contribution and maintain a clear direction for Carbon as
a whole, there are various groups within IBM that provide governance and
support.

## The Carbon team

Carbon is maintained by a dedicated team of designers, developers, and writers
based in the Austin, Texas IBM Design Studio.

## Steering committee

The Carbon Design System Steering Committee provides oversight and direction for
Carbon and its design and development community, and related projects.

### Responsibilities

The key responsibilities of the committee are as follows:

- Improve design strategy, quality, and consistency within the design system.
- Promote and support usage of and contribution to the Carbon Design System
  within their organizations.
- Identify and align components/patterns/content that are multi-product or
  universal.
- Facilitate consolidation of components and patterns where multiples exist -
  i.e. “pick winners”.
- Assess and vote to approve or deny community proposals (e.g. if a particular
  PAL might warrant the "Carbon for [x]" title, if individuals or teams can be
  given _committer_ rights to all or part of the Carbon codebase).
- Approve the creation of working groups and their scope of committed work and
  recommend members who can contribute.
- Assist with standardizing information and tooling to support sharing across
  teams and business units.
- Provide a quarterly update to the Board of Directors.

### Members

To be confirmed.

## Working groups

Working groups are subject matter experts with a particular focus area. They can
be formed from scratch, or might comprise an existing guild or group. They may
be permanent initiatives, or formed for specific projects with a committed scope
of work.

Proposals for the formation of working groups are submitted to the steering
committee for approval.

### Current working groups

#### Developer facilitation

The key responsibilities of this group are:

- Highlight technical challenges and obstacles to adoption, and recommended
  tooling and solutions.
- Work to ensure technical alignment of components and patterns with the system
  as a whole.
- Identify and encourage high quality project maintainers and committers.

Members to be confirmed.

#### Data visualization

The key responsibilities of this group are:

- Prioritize chart and data visualization types for design attention.
- Support teams in using the best chart implementations for their product needs.

Members to be confirmed.

## Board of directors

The Carbon Design System Board of Directors is comprised of executive
stakeholders. They oversee the direction of Carbon.

### Responsibilities

The key responsibilities of the Board are as follows:

- Hold the steering committee, and Carbon as a whole, accountable for delivery
  of design excellence, standards, guidance and business impact.
- Provide the steering committee feedback on business needs, to facilitate a
  Carbon roadmap that meets those needs.
- Champion Carbon adoption and Carbon standards within their organization.
- Where possible, commit to engaging design or development resources from within
  their organization to help accomplish the Carbon roadmap.

The Board is supported by the Steering Committee, whose role is to provide
oversight and direction for Carbon and its community, and related projects.

Members of the Board meet for one half day every quarter, at which they review a
quarterly report from the Steering Committee. This report details the status of
design quality, adoption, and contribution from the product teams/business units
from the Carbon Design System.
